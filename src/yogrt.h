 * yogrt_remaining()'s goal is to unify and simplify the process of retrieving
 * the remaining time available to a job regardless of the
 * underlying system resource manager (e.g. SLURM, Moab, etc.).
 *
 * Performance is a very important design criteria for yogrt_remaining().
 * To acheive the required speed, yogrt_remaining() talks to the resource manager
 * only rarely and caches the remaining time.  Most calls to yogrt_remaining()
 * will only involve a time() library call and simple arithmetic to determine
 * the current remaining time.
 *
 * Exactly how often yogrt_remaining() will talk to the resource manager
 * may be modified with the "interval" functions below.

 * and after the appropriate interval1 or interval2 has passed after calling
 * yogrt_set_remaining(), libyogrt will contact the resource manager for
 * a new remaining time update.

 * value reported by the resource manager.  Subsequent calls to yogrt_remaining()
 * will use simple arithmetic to calculate the remaining time.  If the cached
 * time is older than the update interval, yogrt_remaining() will connect to the
 * the resource manager again to ask for the latest "remaining time" value.
 *
 * There are actually two update intervals that may be set.  The first,
 * "interval1", is used as long as the remaining time is greater than
 * "interval2_start" seconds.  Once the remaining time is less than
 * "interval2_start" seconds, yogrt_remaining() will use the second update
 * interval, "interval2".
 *
 * It should be noted that yogrt_remaining() can and will switch back to using
 * interval1 if the resource manager sufficiently increases the 
 * remaining time of a job.
